1. Open directory (done)
-- renamed to 02_00 format... but note we should look at the bleach format


2. Cluster according to hyb, bleach rounds (bulk rename)
3. Convert ims to tiff (done)
4. Split tiff into separate channels and separate z stacks
5. Group colours according to their z stack
6. Convert tiff to dax (done)

So ideally we would have
Cy3_00_01_01z.dax

Or Cy5_05_88_05z.dax
